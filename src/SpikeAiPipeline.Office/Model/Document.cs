// The document model: one tree for docx, xlsx, and pptx, and office's versioned output contract.
// A document is an ordered list of blocks; a block's "type" names its kind in the JSON. Every
// block but a media block is the document's text, complete without inference.
//
// The kinds this schema version holds are heading, paragraph, list, table, chart, media, sheet,
// and slide; a docx document also holds its sections' headers and footers, its footnotes and
// endnotes, and its comments, referred to from the text by the footnote, endnote, and comment
// inlines. An xlsx document's blocks are its sheets, each holding a table of its cells, whose
// values are typed, then its charts and pictures. A pptx document's blocks are its slides in
// presentation order, each holding its own blocks and its notes' blocks beside them. The model
// grows by adding kinds and optional properties, never by reshaping these.
