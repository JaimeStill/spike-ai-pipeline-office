# Real-world sources

Each file here is copied byte for byte from a permissively licensed repository's test data,
pinned to one commit, and renamed; its SHA-256 below is checked against the blob at that commit.
Every one was written by Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, going by its `docProps/app.xml`
`Application`, and none but one file's parts carry the byte-order mark the Open XML SDK writes
when it re-serializes one. Three were then changed outside the application:

- `docx/word-tables.docx` is Word's file with its last two tables added to its XML (they carry
  none of the `w:rsid` attributes Word gives every other table, row, and paragraph) and re-zipped
  by a tool (every entry dated 2026-07-10 08:13, deflated alike).
- `docx/strict-column-charts.docx` is Word's file re-saved by the Open XML SDK, as the SDK's
  test data for ISO 29500 Strict: every XML part but `[Content_Types].xml` carries the SDK's
  byte-order mark. Its chart parts' Strict XML is what it is here for.
- `docx/chartex.docx`'s two chartEx parts are related and typed as ordinary charts (the `chart`
  relationship and content type, not `chartEx`'s), the drawings refer to them with a `c:chart`
  where Word writes a `cx:chart`, and their `mc:Choice` requires `cx`, where Word's own files
  here require `cx1` or `cx2`. So their XML was placed in Word's file by a tool; it is the
  chartEx schema all the same.

Office writes a chartEx part with no line break after its XML declaration and a space before
each `/>`, and its chart style and colors parts with no declaration at all, unlike the rest of
its parts; that layout is no sign of a tool. A tool shows instead in a UTF-8 byte-order mark
with a lowercase `utf-8` declaration, a chartEx part typed as an ordinary chart, or a `c:chart`
in the drawing. By those, `pptx/chartex-slide.pptx`'s chartEx part is PowerPoint's own: typed
`application/vnd.ms-office.chartex+xml`, referred to by a `cx:chart` under `Requires="cx1"`,
with its chart style and colors parts and its embedded workbook, in a package of entries all
dated 1980-01-01 (as Office zips them) and no byte-order mark. (Its box and whisker chart is
`docx/chartex.docx`'s, with a title there and none here.) The two `rsWordParser` files are
Word's by the same evidence (below).

One poi file here is listed in its `test-data/poi-integration-exceptions.csv`:
`xlsx/simple-strict.xlsx` (`SimpleStrict.xlsx`), as "Strict OOXML isn't currently supported,
please see bug #57699", a limit of poi's, not a fault of the file's.

The two rsWordParser files' provenance is self-reported by a young repository: its README's
许可 (license) section says the corpus documents are the project's own work under its two
licenses, and its notes name the writer as Word LTSC 2021. The files bear that out as Word's:
each chartEx part is typed `application/vnd.ms-office.chartex+xml` and referred to by a
`cx:chart` in the drawing, with its chart style and colors parts and its embedded workbook, the
package's entries are all dated 1980-01-01, and no part carries a byte-order mark. Each file's
`docProps/core.xml` names a person as its last editor; it is left as it is, so the file's
SHA-256 matches its source's.

## What each covers, and what its truth covers

Each file's ground truth is `<name>.truth.json` beside it, in the generated set's format
(`../README.md`). It was written from the file's own XML, unzipped and read part by part, never
from office's output; an xlsx truth's cells were read from the sheet XML by a throwaway script
that knows nothing of office, with which styles are dates decided by hand from each number
format, and the truths of `docx/form-footnotes.docx`, `docx/word-tables.docx`, and
`docx/word-with-attachments.docx` were drafted the same way, by a throwaway script reading
WordprocessingML as the specification describes it, then checked by hand against the XML (all of
the second and third; the first at its smart tags, form fields, picture cell, footnote, and
headings). The charts' truths were read from the chart parts by a throwaway script too, a
Strict chart's namespaces read as Transitional. The two rsWordParser files' truths, a chart and two paragraphs each, were written by hand
from their `word/document.xml` and `word/charts/chartEx1.xml`. When the truth format came to score a table
cell's every element, not only its paragraphs' text, each truth's cells were re-derived from the
document's XML, every cell's paragraphs surveyed for numbering, heading styles and outline
levels, line breaks, and nested tables: only `docx/form-footnotes.docx` has any (headings, list
items, and the footnote reference in cells), and its cells were rebuilt from that survey; the
rest hold plain paragraphs. Every truth is whole: it holds every element of each kind the truth format scores, so
the tests compare all of the model, not a subset.

| File | Covers | Truth covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docx/chart-column.docx` | Word's own chart: a 3-D clustered column chart (`bar3DChart`), titled, three series of cached data over three categories, beside its embedded workbook; a paragraph's text split across runs | all: the paragraph and the chart |
| `docx/chartex.docx` | Word 16's file of six charts: a clustered column chart in the third of three empty bullet items (the chart in a list item), a line chart, a radar chart and a stock chart over date serials, and two chartEx charts in `mc:AlternateContent` with fallback pictures, a box and whisker chart of three series over 22 points and a sunburst of a three-level hierarchy whose branches end at different depths (the regression file for chartEx charts, which were left out; their parts are a tool's, above) | all: the three list items, the paragraph, and the six charts, the chartEx ones as their cached data (`boxWhisker`, `sunburst`, a sunburst point labeled with its innermost level that names it); neither fallback picture, which the cached data replaces |

| `docx/ruby.docx` | a ruby (`w:ruby`): 東京 with its reading, とうきょう, as the annotation (the regression file for ruby, which was dropped whole) | all: the paragraph of the base text; the annotation in `absent` |
| `docx/strict-column-charts.docx` | ISO 29500 Strict: three clustered column charts, untitled, of three series over four categories, in Strict's chart and DrawingML namespaces (the regression file for Strict charts, which were read as `unknown` with no series) | all: the three charts |
| `docx/test-comment.docx` | a comment Word wrote with `commentsExtended`, `commentsIds`, and `commentsExtensible`, anchored mid-paragraph, holding a picture | all: the paragraph with its mark, the comment with its anchor and picture |
| `docx/unit-test-formatting.docx` | three sections: the first referencing default, first-page, and even-page headers and footers with no title page and even-page headers off, the second inheriting, the third with a title page; a first-page footer of three paragraphs and a picture in an `INCLUDEPICTURE` field; hyperlinks; a nested bullet list | all: 15 elements and every section's shown headers and footers |
| `docx/word-tables.docx` | seven tables: uniform; spans across outer and inner columns; vertical spans; every kind of span with empty cells, a span of three rows and one of a whole row; a row starting late (`w:gridBefore`, the regression file for late rows, whose cells were shifted left); a vertical span over a row starting late | all: 15 elements, the late row's cell with `skipBefore` 1 |
| `docx/word-with-attachments.docx` | three comments in Russian, Uzbek, and English across paragraphs, one whose range ends between paragraphs (a block-level `w:commentRangeEnd`) with its reference in the paragraph after (the regression file for block-level ranges, whose anchor was lost); OLE objects (a package, two Word 97 documents, two Excel workbooks) shown as WMF and EMF previews; a VML text box and WordArt; hyperlinks; a table; even-page and default headers with `PAGE` fields, even-page headers off | all: 23 elements, the five OLE previews among them as media, the default header, and the three comments with their anchors.
