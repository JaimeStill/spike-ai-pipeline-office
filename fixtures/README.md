# Fixtures

The documents office's tests read, committed and never generated in the check.

## Generated set

`generate.py` writes each fixture of `generated/` from the definitions in the script itself, then
re-saves it through LibreOffice headless. The docx fixtures are in `generated/docx/`:

- `<name>.python-docx.docx`: written by python-docx, with what python-docx can't write added as
  raw XML or raw package parts: the tracked changes (`w:ins`, `w:del`, `w:moveFrom`, `w:moveTo`,
  a deleted paragraph mark), the drawings of pictures and charts, the chart parts (cached series
  data, no embedded workbook), a picture part of its own and a linked picture's external
  relationship, the footnotes and endnotes parts (with Word's separator and continuation notes),
  and the comments and commentsExtended parts.
- `<name>.libreoffice.docx`: that file opened and saved again by LibreOffice, so the set also
  carries a real application's XML. Both are kept: the first is the XML the script means to
  write, the second what an editor makes of it, and office must read both the same way.
- `<name>.truth.json`: the ground truth both files share, written by the script from the same
  definitions: the accepted-state text of each element in document order (`heading` with its
  level, `paragraph`, `listItem` with its nesting level, whether its level is ordered, and
  whether it starts a list rather than continuing the one before it, `table` with each cell's
  text, its paragraphs joined by a newline, its spans, and its pictures and charts as `media`,
  covered cells left out, `media` with its file name (the SHA-256 of its bytes and its
  extension) and content type or its linked `target`, its `alt` and `title`, and its `section`,
  and `chart` with its type, title, and series), the strings that must appear nowhere in office's
  output (`absent`: deleted text), and the strings that must appear exactly once (`once`: moved
  text). A paragraph's or list item's note and comment references are its `marks`: each one's
  offset in the text, its kind, and its note's or comment's place, from 1, in the truth's list
  of them. Beside the elements, `sections` holds each section's headers and footers as its
  pages show them (kind and elements), `footnotes` and `endnotes` the notes in the order the text
  first references them, and `comments` each thread's author, anchored text, resolved state,
  elements, and replies. Its shape is its own, not office's model, so the tests compare the model
  against it element by element.
- `<name>.libreoffice.truth.json`: the re-save's own ground truth, where LibreOffice changes what
  the document holds; the script writes it from the same definitions, with the change it knows
  LibreOffice makes.

The xlsx fixtures are in `generated/xlsx/`, the same three or four files each:

- `<name>.openpyxl.xlsx`: written by openpyxl, with what openpyxl can't write patched in as raw
  XML: the shared formula, the cell stored as an ISO date (`t="d"`), and the pictures'
  alternative text.
- `<name>.libreoffice.xlsx`: that file re-saved by LibreOffice.
- `<name>.truth.json` and `<name>.libreoffice.truth.json`: each sheet in workbook order, its name,
  whether it is hidden, and its elements: `table` with the rows that have cells, each its `row`
  number and its `cells`, each cell its `ref`, its value's `type` and `value` (a date as ISO
  8601, from the date the script gave openpyxl), its `formula` or its shared formula's anchor
  (`sharedFrom`), and its `colSpan` and `rowSpan` when merged; then its charts and pictures, a
  picture with its `sheet`. The re-save has its own truth wherever its cells differ, which is in
  every fixture with a formula, a boolean, or an error.

The pptx fixtures are in `generated/pptx/`:

- `<name>.python-pptx.pptx`: written by python-pptx on its default template, with what it has no
  API for set on its XML: a hidden slide's `show="0"`, the presentation's slide order, each
  paragraph's own bullet (`buNone`, `buChar`, `buAutoNum`), and the pictures' alternative text
  and title. Its charts are its own, with an embedded workbook and cached series.
- `<name>.libreoffice.pptx`: that file re-saved by LibreOffice.
- `<name>.truth.json` and `<name>.libreoffice.truth.json`: each slide in presentation order, its
  `number`, whether it is `hidden`, its elements in the docx truth's shape (a title is a level-1
  `heading`; a picture's `media` has its `slide`, the slide's index), and its `notes`' elements
  when it has notes. `absent` holds the layouts' and master's prompt texts and LibreOffice's
  notes-page slide-number field, which must appear nowhere.

| Fixture | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `headings` | heading levels 1 to 4 from heading styles, a level-2 heading from a paragraph's outline level alone, paragraphs, a line break, and text Markdown would misread |

| `drawings` (xlsx) | a bar chart over the sheet's cells; the same picture twice on one sheet; a second sheet's picture |
| `dates-1904` (xlsx) | dates and a datetime on the 1904 date system's first day (serial 0.5), and a plain number |
| `slides` (pptx) | five slides presented in an order that isn't their parts' (welcome, hidden, agenda, closing, questions), a hidden slide, notes of one and two paragraphs on three slides, a title slide's subtitle whose layout turns the master's bullets off, a text box, and a content placeholder left empty |
| `bullets` (pptx) | a content placeholder's master bullets nested three levels and back, a paragraph whose own bullet is none between lists, a numbered list with a bullet nested in it, a bullet list right after it at the same level; a text box's plain paragraph, its own bullets nested, its own number, an empty paragraph |

What LibreOffice's re-save changes, checked by unzipping it:

- It writes a picture's title and description as one description, the title's line first, and
  no title (`media`, `sections`: their LibreOffice truth says so).
- It gives a section the default header and footer as its first-page ones where it should
  inherit a first-page variant through a section without a title page (`sections`), and writes
  an inherited header's copies with their deletions as plain text, so the fixture keeps its
  tracked header change in a header no other section inherits.
- It pairs footnotes with their references by their order in the notes part, not by id, so its
  first reference shows the first-defined note (`notes`).
- It keeps one part for the bytes the python-docx file stores twice, so only the python-docx
  file has two parts of the same picture; the bytes themselves, the EMF among them, it keeps as
  they are.
- It drops the deleted paragraph mark before the table, writing that text as a plain paragraph:
  the truth is the same, but only the python-docx file has the case.
- It keeps the charts' cached data, the notes (renumbering them, the separators too), the
  comments' replies and resolved state (in its own commentsExtended), and the linked picture.

And in an xlsx file, where openpyxl's file and LibreOffice's differ:

- openpyxl writes every string inline (`t="inlineStr"`), rich text as inline runs; LibreOffice
  writes them all as shared strings, rich text as shared runs. So each variant covers one kind.
- openpyxl writes a formula with an empty cached value (`<v></v>`); LibreOffice computes and
  caches every formula's value, the array formula's other cells' too, which openpyxl leaves out.
- LibreOffice writes a constant boolean as the formula `TRUE()` or `FALSE()` and a constant error
  as a formula of itself (`#N/A`), each with its cached value.
- LibreOffice expands the shared formula into each cell's own formula: only openpyxl's file has
  a shared formula, and LibreOffice writes none of its own.
- LibreOffice writes the ISO-date cell as its serial number in the General format, a number.
- LibreOffice writes the built-in date formats as custom codes (`m/d/yyyy` for 14), so only
  openpyxl's file has built-in date ids; it escapes literal characters (`yyyy\-mm\-dd`) and
  rounds numbers to 15 significant digits, which the times survive to the millisecond.
- openpyxl writes the chart's references with no cached data, so its chart has a title and one
  series with no name, categories, or values; LibreOffice caches them.
- openpyxl stores the twice-shown picture in two parts; LibreOffice keeps one. Either way it is
  one file.
- LibreOffice writes a very hidden sheet as hidden; both are `hidden`. It keeps the merges
  (writing the covered cells as empty styled cells), the 1904 date system, the sheet order, and
  the pictures' alternative text.

And in a pptx file, where python-pptx's file and LibreOffice's differ:

- python-pptx leaves bullets to inheritance: a content placeholder's paragraphs take the
  master's body style's bullets, a subtitle its layout's `buNone`. LibreOffice writes every
  placeholder paragraph's bullet, or `buNone`, on the paragraph itself, so only python-pptx's
  file has inherited bullets; both read the same.
- LibreOffice renames the slide parts in presentation order, so only python-pptx's file has
  parts out of order. It keeps the hidden slide, the notes, the group shapes, the table's
  `gridSpan`, `rowSpan`, `hMerge`, and `vMerge`, the empty placeholder (as an empty paragraph),
  and the pictures' descriptions in one part per content.
- LibreOffice drops a picture's title (`slide-objects`: its LibreOffice truth says so), writes
  each notes page's slide-number placeholder with a `<number>` field, writes a centered title as
  a title, and drops the chart's embedded workbook, keeping its caches.

## Regenerating

From the repository root, with LibreOffice's `soffice` on the path and no LibreOffice window open
on the same profile (the script uses a throwaway one):

```sh
mise run fixtures
```

That runs `uv run --script fixtures/generate.py`; the script's inline metadata pins python-docx,
openpyxl, and python-pptx, and `generate.py.lock` pins the rest. It rewrites every file of `generated/`, or with fixture
names as arguments (`uv run --script fixtures/generate.py notes media`) only those fixtures'
files, and the section below, which lists every fixture's files as they are on disk. Both
writers stamp the time into the package, so a rerun changes a package's bytes and checksum
even when nothing else changed; regenerate only the fixtures a change needs.
